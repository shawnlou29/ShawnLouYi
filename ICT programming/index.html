  <h2>Xiao Tech</h2>
  <p>The Xiao Tech: "A local friend for a traveler that offers experiential and tailor-made travel programs." We are a versatile and transparent platform where users can find exclusive and immersive experiences, such as living a villager's lifestyle for a few days or studying traditional craftsmanship. Or our users can just complete a tiny questionnaire and get a highly tailored customer made travel schedule in seconds by bookings in a click and a 24/7 live concierge while traveling. Business model: We combine tours, unique events, lodging, transportation, etc., and either sell tours directly in the form of experiences, or provide customized experiences through an AI-based platform. We charge clients a small service fee rather than any commissions.We also plan to charge our suppliers a very small annual membership fee. Technology: We have been manually providing our services, i.e., we have been designing our customized travel plans, making all the bookings for the past two years. (We have currently given them one year free as per our agreement.) Technology: We also have 24/7 customer support, and for any customer, that's a lot of work.Ruby, a former client from New Zealand, is an example. It took her seven days to construct an itinerary, and it took us another four to five days to make her reservations, and we provided 24/7 help. We can reduce this time to about one second via AI (itinerary building and booking). We are finalizing the first step of our product right now. In future phases of our product (we've split it into five phases) With a combination of augmented reality and artificial intelligence, we want to turn it into a utility app that allows a user to understand a place he or she is heading to or is already in, something that helps in terms of audio guides/video guides, enhanced accessibility, regular travel plans, suggestions, tips and tricks and much more.

  <h3>Definition of the device brief (what does the sytem intended to do)</h3>
 According to me, the most difficult part of founding a company is taking the mistakes and achievements in phase and moving on.

To be honest, I've faced far, far more failures than accomplishments â€” we've even begun with a negative balance in our accounts and no cash, with a lot of CCD meetings, spending 10 to 11 hours per day trying various things out. This journey was demanding.

The biggest obstacle, however, was when my co-founder, with whom I had been living and working for the past 2-2.5 years, began facing some personal issues, and he had to step down as Xiao Tech's COO because of depression.

I haven't articulated it to him yet, but those two months have been totally devastating to me, because he stopped responding to our messages and calls at some point. He was one of my best friends and I was hit hard by this sudden growth. Those few months were a nightmare, and things turned 180 degrees for us.

Finally, I went with my CTO to Chandigarh to meet our advisor, who was not aware of the situation, and he advised me to start building a team again immediately.

We both went home and had a long conversation for three hours, after which we agreed to move on.
I began to meet new people, to reveal all of our ideas, and eventually, I was able to cut down on four people who had become part of our core team. Together, we have begun to concentrate a lot on earning income since the last few months have hit us financially hard.

I'm currently managing a team of 50 people, including full-time and part-time staff, interns and freelancers working from home.</p>
